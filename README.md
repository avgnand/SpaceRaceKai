# Space Race Kai

## Introduction
This web app is a game design tool that you can use to simulate the creation and management of colonies in outer space. 
These colonies represent sovereign states that the player governs as a president or prime minister. 
As the player's main control mechanic in the game, decisions concerning the welfare of colonies (called "Decision Events") are presented during gameplay, however other events, called "World Events", also occur beyond player control and affect the colony in various ways.
The stats of colonies persist between playthroughs, allowing for continuous development.

## Gameplay
By default, a game consists of 10 randomly-chosen events that will impact the colony selected on the 'Play a Game' page. 
Of these events, 5 are World Events and 5 are Decision Events. 
Each event is sequentially revealed to the player one by one, starting with the World Events. 
Once the player reaches Decision Events, a choice with two options is presented for each event. 
The effects of all 10 events are summed up after the last event has been decided, and the colony will be updated to reflect the changes.

# Getting Started
The project's associated database starts off empty, so you will need to add data into it yourself after cloning it. Below are the entities that represent the database schema and their properties, along with the associated data types. Also, all models include an 'ID' property that represents its place in a database table.

### Application User
An entity class that inherits from `IdentityUser` as part of the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` namespace. This class is generated by default when creating a Blazor-WebAssembly project in Visual Studio. It holds many fields to represent a user on the site, including email and password, as well as an ID that is of type **string** and is used when creating entities that require a Foreign Key reference to a user entity.

### Planet Type
- Name (**string**): A name that represents the general character of the world (e.g., "Archipelago" for a world whose land masses are numerous and relatively small and island-like)
- Temperature Rating (**int**): The "average" surface temperature of the world, which can represent degrees Farenheit or Celsius, as the project's pages are agnostic regarding the measurement type
- Land Cover (**int**): The percentage of the planet's land that is above sea level

### Colony
A colony in Space Race Kai is an entire planet as an independent state in space.
- Name (**string**): A name as any country or sovereignty on Earth would have
- Population (**int**): An integer representation of the total populace of a planet colony
- Approval Rating (**int**): An integer that represents an abstract measurement of the support that the colony's citizens have for the planet's governing body (aka, the player)
- Wealth Level (**int**): An integer representation of a colony's economic success
- Tech Level (**int**): An integer representation of a colony's technological and scientific advancement
- Industry Level (**int**): An integer representation of a colony's industrial production and manufacturing capabilities
- User ID (**string**): The globally unique ID (GUID) of the user in the database that is associated with the colony
- Planet Type ID (**int**): The ID of an entity in the database that represents the colony's world

### Event Effect
Each of an Event Effect's properties represents either an increase or decrease in a colony's relative stat as a result of a World Event or Decision Event.
- Population Change (**int**)
- Approval Change (**int**)
- Wealth Change (**int**)
- Tech Change (**int**)
- Industry Change (**int**)

### World Event
A Worl Event is ideally meant to represent an event that is uniquely able to occur given the circumstances of the particular planet in which a colony exists. At time of writing (9/1/22), the Planet Type of a World Event does not affect whether or not a player encounters it during gameplay.
- Name (**string**)
- Description (**string**): A short paragraph that gives context to the player as to how the event will impact their colony
- Planet Type ID (**int**): The ID of a Planet Type where the event is most likely to occur
- Event Effect ID (**int**): The ID of an Event Effect that represents the outcome of the World Event

### Decision Event
- Name (**string**)
- Description (**string**): Brief text that provides context to the player to inform their choice between the two Event Effects available
- Event Effect ID A (**int**): The ID of an Event Effect that represents one of two possible outcomes of the Decision Event
- Event Effect ID B (**int**): The ID of a second Event Effect, which can optionally be the same as the first option, in the case that the decision is ultimately moot, for example
