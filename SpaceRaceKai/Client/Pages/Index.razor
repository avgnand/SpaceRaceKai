        This web app is a game design tool that you can use to simulate the creation and management of colonies in outer space. 
        These colonies represent sovereign states that the player governs as a president or prime minister. 
        As the player's main control mechanic in the game, decisions concerning the welfare of colonies (called "Decision Events") are presented during gameplay, however other events, called "World Events", also occur beyond player control and affect the colony in various ways.
        The stats of colonies persist between playthroughs, allowing for continuous development.
